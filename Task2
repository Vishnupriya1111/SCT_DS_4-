# DS Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

## Introduction

This document details the process and findings of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset. The goal of this task was to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the `titanic_train.csv` file, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their age, gender, class, and survival status.

## Steps Performed

1.  **Data Loading:**
    * Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
    * Displayed the first few rows to get an overview of the data.

2.  **Data Cleaning:**
    * Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
    * Addressed inconsistencies and corrected data types.
    * Removed unnecessary columns.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * **Summary Statistics:** Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
    * **Univariate Analysis:**
        * Analyzed the distribution of individual variables (e.g., age, fare, gender).
        * Used histograms, bar charts, and box plots to visualize the distributions.
    * **Bivariate Analysis:**
        * Examined relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., survival vs. gender, survival vs. class).
        * Used cross-tabulations, grouped bar charts, and scatter plots to visualize the relationships.
    * **Correlation Analysis:**
        * Calculated the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical variables.
        * Used a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.

## Key Findings and Interpretations

1.  **Survival Rate:**
    * The overall survival rate was around 38%.
    * This indicates that a majority of passengers did not survive.

2.  **Gender:**
    * Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
    * This confirms the "women and children first" policy.

3.  **Passenger Class:**
    * Passengers in higher classes (1st and 2nd) had a higher survival rate than those in 3rd class.
    * This suggests that social class played a significant role in survival.

4.  **Age:**
    * Children had a higher survival rate.
    * There were more deaths in the adult age groups.

5.  **Fare:**
    * Passengers who paid higher fares had a higher survival rate.
    * This correlates with passenger class, as higher classes paid higher fares.

6.  **Embarked:**
    * Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate compared to Southampton (S) and Queenstown (Q).
    * This may be related to the passenger class distribution at each port.

7.  **Missing Values:**
    * The "Age" column had a significant number of missing values, which were imputed using the median.
    * The "Cabin" column had many missing values and was dropped due to low information.

## Conclusion

The EDA revealed several factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic. Gender, passenger class, and age were significant predictors of survival. These insights can be used to build predictive models and further understand the circumstances surrounding the Titanic disaster.

## Recommendations

* Further analysis could involve feature engineering to create new variables that might improve predictive models.
* Machine learning models could be built to predict passenger survival based on the analyzed features.
