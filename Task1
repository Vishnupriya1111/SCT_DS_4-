# Task 1: Population Distribution by Age Group

**Description:**
This task involved visualizing the distribution of population across different age groups using Tableau. A bar chart was created to represent the population in millions for the age ranges: 0-20, 21-40, and 65+.

**Dataset:**
The data was provided in the "Sheet1 (Book)" data source and included the "Age Group" and "Population (Millions)" fields.

**Tool Used:**
Tableau Desktop

**Visualization:**
A bar chart was created with "Age Group" on the Columns shelf and "SUM(Population (Millions))" on the Rows shelf.

**Results and Findings:**

* The bar chart clearly shows the population distribution across the three age groups.
* The 0-20 age group has the highest population (approximately 800 million).
* The 21-40 age group has a significant population (approximately 500 million).
* The 65+ age group has the lowest population (approximately 100 million).

**Image of the Visualization:**
(You can add a screenshot of your Tableau chart here by uploading the image to your repository and referencing it in the Markdown. For example: `![Population Distribution Chart](path/to/your/image.png)`)

**Instructions to Recreate the Visualization:**

1. Open Tableau Desktop.
2. Connect to the "Sheet1 (Book)" data source.
3. Drag "Age Group" to the Columns shelf.
4. Drag "Population (Millions)" to the Rows shelf.
5. Tableau will automatically create a bar chart.

**Challenges Faced:**
No significant challenges were encountered during this task.
